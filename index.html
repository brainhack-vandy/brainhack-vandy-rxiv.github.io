                    <h3>A Quick Dive into Brainhack</h3>
                    So, you've heard of hackathons, right? Now, imagine that vibe but tailored specifically for the brainy world of neuroscience. That's Brainhack for you!
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h3>Why the Buzz Around Brainhack?</h3>
                    Neuroscience has some big questions on its plate. To tackle them (we're talking about massive datasets and some serious analytical firepower) Brainhack steps in. It's like a global rendezvous for brain enthusiasts, data geeks, and everyone in between.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h3>What's Cooking at Brainhack?</h3>
                    Brainhack isn't just another science conference. Picture a global playground where researchers from all corners and fields come together. They roll up their sleeves and dive headfirst into some cool neuroscience projects. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Brainhack has this groovy mix of Hackathon energy with Unconference spontaneity. Workshops? Check. Brainstorming data science tools for neuroscience? Double-check. A major chunk is all about open collaboration. Imagine teams from different disciplines geeking out and brainstorming solutions for neuroscience puzzles.
                </p>
                    And because learning never stops, Brainhack has a side of tutorials. Dive into Python, get friendly with GitHub, float around in cloud computing, or dive deep into some fresh statistical methods.
                    To wrap it up, Brainhack isn't just an event—it's a vibe. A place where data science flirts with neuroscience, all in the name of unlocking the secrets of the brain. Cool, right?

                            Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a powerful and widely used technique in human brain research, 
                            measuring blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) changes in the brain, as a PROXY for neural activity. Due to 
                            blood-oxygen dependency, two major influences on fMRI data are respiration and cardiac related processes which 
                            affect blood-oxygen levels in the brain. So people collect the measures of respiration and heart rate concurrently 
                            with fMRI to study and also to remove these effects. Fantastic! But here is the catch, like any other data we 
                            need to quality-check! Let's face it, checking the quality of this data can be a real headache. It usually 
                            involves a time consuming tedious manual labor and is prone to human error - you need to know what is real 
                            data, what is an artifact. That's why we want to create a nifty deep-learning tool to automate quality 
                            assessment! This tool doesn't just check the quality of your data; it also points out any issues and gives 
                            you tips on how to fix them. It's like having a friendly expert on your team, making sure your research data 
                            is as good as it can be!

                                Since their discovery, resting state networks have elucidated our understanding of cognitive function such as 
                                emotion processing, working memory, and daydreaming. Additionally, a collective of scientists believe resting 
                                state networks may be a possible biomarker of mental disorders. However, before we can confirm resting state 
                                networks point to a characteristic of mental disorders it is important to model how they change across age. 
                                Many studies have identified that age does influence the connectivity of resting state networks however which 
                                brain regions within resting state networks change specifically needs to be further understood. The goal of this 
                                project is to compare methods of how resting state network information are retrieved and potentially model how 
                                they change across age.
